# Flutter-UI-Kit  

Hello, welcome to my 25-day design challenge. I am Vignesh, a front-end-focused full-stack developer. Working as a developer from India, it is often expected not only just develop the application, but also to design it accessibly and aesthetically pleasing. For the applications I develop, I typically acquire design ideas from Behance and Dribble. Exploring the other realms of the Software Development lifecycle, UX/UI design is something that piqued my interest. Working on it made me realize that my interests are aligned with UX research and design to provide an efficient solution. So this is a compilation of my inspirations from the internet which I have designed/recreated using Figma and developed using Flutter.
